#
# This is a simple recipe which shows how deployr could be used.
#
# Launch it like so:
#
#    deployr -target root@host.example.com:22 ./deploy.recipe
#

#
# Set a variable
#
Set greeting "Hello, world!"


#
#
# This copies the file `example.recipe.template` to the remote host,
# expanding any variables prior to the copy.
#
CopyTemplate example.recipe.template /tmp/blah

#
# This will show the contents of that file.
#
Run "cat /tmp/blah"

#
# The following command will only be executed if the remote file is
# updated.  So you'll see the output the first time, but not the second
# time you run this example
#
IfChanged "sha1sum /tmp/blah"
