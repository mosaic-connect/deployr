#
# Deploy Steve's puppet-summary application.
#
# The puppet-summary application is developed on github, and only
# fixed releases are installed via release-page of the project:
#
#    https://github.com/skx/puppet-summary/releases
#
# The software is deployed to the single host `master.steve.org.uk`
# and I connect to that host via SSH as the root-user.
#
# At the time of writing the most recent release is version 1.2
#


#
# Specify the host to which we're deploying.
#
# Public-key authentication is both assumed and required.
#
DeployTo root@master.steve.org.uk:2222

#
# Set the release version as a variable named "RELEASE".
#
Set RELEASE "1.3.1"

#
# Now that RELEASE is defined it can be used as ${RELEASE} in the rest of
# this file.
#

#
# To deploy the software I need to fetch it.  Do that with `wget`:
#
Run "wget --quiet -O /srv/puppet-summary/tmp.puppet-summary-linux-amd64-${RELEASE} \
    https://github.com/skx/puppet-summary/releases/download/release-${RELEASE}/puppet-summary-linux-amd64"

#
# Copy it into-place
#
Run "mv /srv/puppet-summary/tmp.puppet-summary-linux-amd64-${RELEASE}  \
 /srv/puppet-summary/puppet-summary-linux-amd64-${RELEASE}"

#
# Create a symlink from this versioned download to an unqualified name.
#
Run "ln -sf /srv/puppet-summary/puppet-summary-linux-amd64-${RELEASE} \
   /srv/puppet-summary/puppet-summary"


#
# Ensure the downloaded file is executable.
#
Run "chmod 755 /srv/puppet-summary/puppet*"

#
# Finally we need to make sure there is a systemd unit-file in-place which
# will start the service
#
CopyFile lib/systemd/system/*.service /lib/systemd/system/
IfChanged "systemctl daemon-reload"
IfChanged "systemctl enable puppet-summary.service"

#
# And now we should be able to stop/start the service
#
Run "systemctl stop  puppet-summary.service"
Run "systemctl start puppet-summary.service"
