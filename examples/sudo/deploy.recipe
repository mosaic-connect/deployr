# This is a simple recipe which demonstrates the usage of "sudo".
#
# Launch it like so:
#
#   $ deployr -target user@host.example.com:22 ./deploy.recipe
#
# Sample output:
#
#   $ deployr run -target steve@host.example.com deploy.recipe
#   Please enter your password for sudo: s4cr3t
#
#   This command runs as "steve"
#   uid=1000(steve) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),1007(steve),1034(ssh_users)
#
#   This command runs as "root"
#   uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1034(ssh_users)
#
#



#
# "Run" executes a command as the user we connect with.
#
Run "echo 'This command runs as \"${user}\"'"
Run "/usr/bin/id"



#
# "Sudo Run" runs a command as root.
#
Run "echo 'This command runs as \"root\"'"
Sudo Run "/usr/bin/id"
